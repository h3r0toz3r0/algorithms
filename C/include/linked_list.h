/**
 * @brief Function pointer type for a custom delete function.
 * 
 * This function pointer is intended to delete or free the data stored
 * within a linked list node. For simple data types (e.g., integers, 
 * basic structs), this can be as straightforward as pointing to the 
 * `free` function.
 * 
 * @param p_data Pointer to the data within the node that needs to be deleted.
 * 
 * @note The function should handle any necessary cleanup to avoid memory leaks.
 * 
 * @example
 * To delete integers/chars/strings:
 * @code
 * void delete_function(void *p_data) {
 *     free(p_data);
 *     p_data = NULL;
 * }
 * @endcode

 * @brief Function pointer type for a custom print function.

 * 
 * @param p_data Pointer to the data within the node that needs to be printed.
 * 
 * @note Ensure the function properly formats the output according to the 
 *       data type being printed.
 * 
 * @example
 * To print integers:
 * @code
 * void print_int(void *p_data) {

 * @endcode
 *

/**
 * @brief Function pointer type for a custom comparison function.
 * 
 * This function pointer is designed to compare two arbitrary data types 
 * stored within linked list nodes. The comparison function should return 
 * an integer value that indicates the relative order of the two data items, 
 * similar to the behavior of the standard `strcmp` function.
 * 
 * @param p_lhs Pointer to the left-hand side data for comparison.
 * @param p_rhs Pointer to the right-hand side data for comparison.
 * 
 * @returns 
 * - A negative value if p_lhs is less than p_rhs.
 * - Zero if p_lhs is equal to p_rhs.
 * - A positive value if p_lhs is greater than p_rhs.
 * 
 * @note The return values are intended to be compatible with standard 
 *       sorting and comparison functions, following the conventions 
 *       established by `strcmp`.
 * 
 * @example
 * To compare integers:
 * @code
 * int compare_ints(void *p_lhs, void *p_rhs) {
 *     int lhs = *(int *)p_lhs;
 *     int rhs = *(int *)p_rhs;
 *     return (lhs > rhs) - (lhs < rhs);

 * To compare characters:
 * @code
 * int compare_chars(void *p_lhs, void *p_rhs) {
 *     char lhs = *(char *)p_lhs;
 *     char rhs = *(char *)p_rhs;
 *     return (lhs > rhs) - (lhs < rhs);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * To compare strings:
 * @code
 * int compare_strings(void *p_lhs, void *p_rhs) {
 *     return strcmp((char *)p_lhs, (char *)p_rhs);
 * }
